# Contributing to UI

We appreciate that you've taken an interest in `ui` and your welcome
to fork and play with it as you see fit.


## Issues

Feel free to open an issue if you notice a bug or would like a new
feature etc. But before you do, make sure that there's no existing
issue, open or closed that would be a duplicate.


## Pull Requests
  
1) Start your pull-request early so we can discuss the content as it progresses
2) Run the tests and manually check that your code executes as expected before committing
3) Ensure that sufficient documentation is in place
4) Prepend your change to [CHANGES.org](./CHANGES.org)
5) Ãˆt voila! Your request will likely be granted ðŸ˜‡


Thank you!
